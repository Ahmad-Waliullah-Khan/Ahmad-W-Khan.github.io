###### *Reading time : **2 minutes, 43 seconds.***

I don’t know if it is because of all the heavy smoking that I have started doing recently or the anti-depressant along with other meds that I have been taking for a long time or even some kind of reaction with nicotine and my meds, but I have been feeling this weird sense of calmness that I haven’t felt in a long while. But with this calmness comes a weird sense of contentment and freedom. I also started fantasizing about dying recently. No no! don’t go on calling me. I am not suicidal. I just can’t wait to die. And it is this ability to be able to clearly visualize my own inevitable destination that has slowly made me feel at ease in this chaotic world. I am feeling less afraid now. But with that also comes some self-destructive behaviour which I am trying to take care off. But it is still an interesting state of mind to be in. All my life I have looked at these suicidal people and thought of them as weak and confused. But maybe they were onto something. Maybe death is the ultimate freedom and peace. 

I am not persuading you to jump off a cliff. No, what I am saying is we get so caught up in this life’s web that we forget to live. We feel sad when things aren’t going our way and when it does go our way we try to hold on to the happiness. But we forget that the life is like a wheel of fortune. “Fortune” whether it is wealth, health, experiences or loved ones, come and they eventually go and then there is absolute possibility for things to get better again. So instead of worrying about the ups and downs and let them distract us, we have to see this as wheel of fortune that throws both highs and lows at us, but neither of them are long lasting. Instead of worrying about holding onto our happiness, why don’t we get busy living? Don’t just exist, live. If all of our ultimate destination is death anyway, then why don’t we make the most of our lives. Why don’t we see our life as a story? And if it is a story then don’t we owe it to ourselves to make it a meaningful one, or at the least, make it an interesting read? I mean when was the last time you did something because you desire it so much? When was the last time you read a book for the sole purpose of pleasure of your soul? When did you sit outside in the middle of the night staring at the stars, doing nothing? 

So, let’s just say fuck it to every obstacle and live, instead of just existing. We have very limited time in our hands. We cannot give it away to everyone. Be selfish for once and make your story a good one. And I am sure all of you have wonderful tales to tell. And I can’t wait to read all about it. Make death your closest companion for it is only through the ability to contemplate and comprehend your own mortality will you truly be free. Never wait till you are in your deathbed to regret what you could have done. How you could have lived. Live right here, and right now. Seize your fucking moment. You have got one shot at this, make it count. 

So, here's a little thought experiment for you : If you had one year to live, how would you live it ? what would you do differently? What bucket list items you would wanna tick off?
