###### *Reading time : **5 minutes, 3 seconds. ***


Jabbar wakes up gasping and screaming something in Arabic. He looks around, the bed to his right is empty and quite messy. It’s Raju’s bed. Raju is in Delhi for the weekend. The bed to the left is also empty but less messy than Raju’s. That’s where Shashank sleeps. But he also went home for the weekend. The two fans over his head are spinning at the highest speed, yet Jabbar is sweating like a pig.

It is too hot in the room, which is quite unusual for Jabbar since he is from Shillong and it is usually cold there during March. But weather of Goa is the last thing he wants to complain about right now. That’s not the stuff that occupies a lot of his thoughts. The lights are on. Jabbar can’t remember leaving the lights on. He actually can’t even remember when he fell asleep. He tries to look for his phone by tracing his tangled earphones around his neck and finally finds the phone under his back. The phone’s lock screen shows it’s 3.14 AM, Saturday, 9th March. He unlocks the screen and the audiobook _“The Courage to Be Disliked” by Ichiro Kishimi_ is playing. 

_“Fuck...“_

Jabbar cusses in frustration. He missed the chapter, again.

He gets up and turns of the lights and drinks water from the bottle by the bedside and goes back to bed. If it was few months earlier, he would have left the lights on and written down the nightmare in his journal. But at this point of time, he doesn’t even care about these daily nightmares anymore. He doesn’t even bother trying to remember what was it that he was yelling in his sleep or what is it that the nightmare was about. He gets nightmares like these every night after the incident. So, these seem to him like merely some scenes from a cheap sci-fi movie.

_“Go back to sleep dude… it was just a nightmare.”_

He tells himself. His mind is racing. Should he bring these nightmares up in his session with Dr. Cordoza in the morning. 

_“Nah dude.. That’s silly...these don’t mean anything.”_

He tells himself while laughing out loud. He gets up from the bed and turns the light back on. He opens the door expecting to find Kumaran and Vishal in the hall playing video game. But the hall is dark. No one is there. Lights are turned off and only the sound of the fans and Vishal’s snoring can be heard. But he could have sworn he heard Kumaran and Vishal talking about something in the hall. 

_“Hahaha...nah man!...Jabbar is a fucking coward...he won’t have the balls to do that...”_

Jason’s voice coming from the other room.

_“Fuck you Jason!”_

Yells Jabbar. But no reply from the other room. He goes out of the room, through the hall and stands outside Jason’s room. But he can see that there is no light coming from Jason’s room. He slowly opens the door to Jason’s room but finds Jason sleeping. 

_“Ah Fuck! … not again”_

He says in anger.

He closes the door and almost runs back to his room. He turns of the fan. He is suddenly feeling cold. He runs towards the drawer beside his bed. 

_“Fuck, Fuck, Fuck...”_

He takes out the Amisulpride tablets from the drawer. His hands are shaking. He reaches for the bottle but knocks the bottle over spilling the remaining water to the floor.

_“Motherfuck.."_

He cusses in anger. He forgot to take the medication tonight. 

_“How could I be so reckless”_

He thinks to himself. He has to pass the hall and the corridor, to get to the water purifier in the kitchen.

_“It’s nothing dude… just all in your head…. should have taken the tablets.."_

He hasn’t missed the tablets after coming to Goa. But tonight after coming back from beach, he must have forgotten to take the medication.

He finally decides to take the tablet with the tap water from the vasin.

_“It’s nothing, it’s all in your head”_

He goes back to bed and covers himself with the bedsheet, puts on the earphones and hits play on the “instrumental” playlist on his music player. 

He is starting to sweat again. He gets up and turns both the fans on and quickly comes back to bed and covers himself up under bedsheet. 

The sound of the violin in the song is making him agitated.

_“What the fuck is this song!”_

He looks at the screen and it shows the name of one of his favourite violin songs. But right now it feels like the sound of a cat dying to him. He is starting to sweat more. 

_“La hawla wala qu’wata illa billah”_

He is murmuring some Arabic Dua to himself repeatedly. He is constantly looking at the door and then to the other door. 

He takes out the earphone from his right ear.

_“Is somebody calling me?“_

He takes out the other earphone and listens. Only the sound of fans can be heard. He is afraid to get up and open the door to see if anyone is there in the hall.

_“Awesome, it’s gonna be another long fucking night. Hahaha”_

He laughs and puts the earphone on and starts watching gameplay walkthrough videos of his favourite fighting game on YouTube.

He is finding it hard to make sense of what the commentators are saying in the video. But he still doesn’t stop the video and keeps watching the match, trying to focus on the fight. It is one of his favorite match, between Diago Umahara and Gamebee from EVO 2012. 

 ----------------------------------

Phone is vibrating and a Nasheed is playing as the alarm sound. Jabbar looks at the phone, it is almost 11 am in the morning. 

_“Shit!... Dr. Cordoza’s session”_

He can’t remember when he fell asleep. But he feels tired. But can’t miss this session with Dr. Cordoza. He jumps out from the bed and takes his towel opens the door to run towards bathroom, switching off the lights and fans on his way. Vishal and Kumaran are still asleep in the room beside the hall. It is Saturday morning after all.
