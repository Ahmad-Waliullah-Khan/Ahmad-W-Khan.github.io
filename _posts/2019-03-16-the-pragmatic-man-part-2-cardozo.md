###### *Reading time : **15 minutes, 40 seconds.***

“I am here for the 12 o’clock appointment with Dr. Cardozo.” 

Jabbar says to the receptionist, while taking the earphones off. The receptionist gives him a confused look and then looks at the clock. It's 12:50.

“Sorry, I am late. I couldn’t get a cab in time.”

Jabbar tells her, smiling nervously. 

_“Ohkay!... Jabbar, right ? … please have a seat. I’ll call you when she is ready”_

Jabbar takes a seat near the glass window which is looking out to the road outside. He feels a calming effect rushing through him by looking at the soundless cars driving by outside. He puts on the earphone and starts looking at the books kept on the small round table. These look to him like children’s books. And by the look and title of the books, he assumes these are some classic and well known books. But he won’t have an idea about that considering his childhood. He opens one of the books and immediately starts smiling to see the bright, colourful pictures in the book. Reminds him of the comic books he used to collect in his childhood. 

_“She will see you now.”_

Jabbar takes off the earphones to see the receptionist grinning at him.

 He follows her to the room. 

_“Hi, please come in. Have a seat.”_

Cardozo says, smiling at him.

“Umm.. where?”

Jabbar thinks to himself. He hasn’t been to this room before. The room is much bigger than the last room he had session in. It seemed like a bedroom which has been turned into an office. On his left there is a wooden desk and a chair. The files and papers are organized neatly on the table. The desk reminds him of the one his father had in his childhood home. The chair is a leather executive office chair. Reminds him of his gaming chair back home. There is a couch opposite to the desk. At first, he thinks about sitting there, but then his eyes fall on two recliners to the left of the couch with a small plastic table to the right. So, he walks towards one of the recliner looking chairs while thinking to himself, what idiot designed this interior. 

She sits and takes a sip of water from the glass on the table to his right. There is also a container with tissue papers on it. 

“So cliche” 

Jabbar scoffs in his head.

_“Should I turn the AC on ?”_

She asks, pointing with the remote.

“Ya, sure”

Replies Jabbar while nodding.

_“So, how have you been Jabbar ?”_

She asks while taking a look at the notes she took in the previous session.

“Good, except I have been feeling too agitated and overwhelmed recently”

Says Jabbar while re adjusting his posture in his chair.

_“Okay. Well, you did tell me in the last session that you were facing a lot of anxiety. And we traced back to your past incidents a bit also.”_

“Yes, but like I told you earlier, I don’t think I am holding onto my past anymore. In fact, I hardly recall my past incidents.”

Jabbar replies while shifting in his chair again.

_“Yes, but I think the incidents and experiences you had faced in the past, especially in your childhood are making it hard for you to deal with these passive symptoms that you said you are facing. Okay… let’s do one thing. For today’s session, let’s focus on dealing with your over worrying and feeling of overwhelming and let’s take it from there, alright ?”_

“Okay, that sounds good.”

_“In the last session, we came to know that you have been facing a lot of excessive worries. Can you tell me what exactly are the things that are worrying you recently?”_

“Well… I think I am over planning everything. I am being a control freak… “

_“Why?”_

“Well… I think … I wanna have everything according to my expectations… I mean.. I hate unpredictability and I think that’s why I want to control the outcomes of the situations… and...that leads me to micromanage things I guess.”

_“Uhm.. so, why do you think you need to have the situations predictable? ”_

“I don't know...but I just can't seem to help it. Before every situation, I'll go over every possible scenarios and will try to cover every corner. And that's also not about the bigger situations. It happens with smaller stuff too.”

_“Well ..it is good to plan things out. But, sometimes, some things aren't under our control. Do you not agree? … like for example, you were coming to this clinic right? Well.. the planning part was, you got up early, you made sure you left home early… but suppose on the way, there's a roadblock for some construction work or something, and you had to wait there for 30 minutes. Well, that could have led to unpredictable and unwanted situations like missing the appointment.. right?”_

“Ya..”

Jabbar is practically rolling his eyes in his head. He has heard these things thousands of times and he has told himself these things numerous times. He was expecting more professional answer or explanation maybe.

_“I know what I am saying must sound recycled to you. But just try to understand what I am trying to say. It’s good to plan. But you have to be able to differentiate between the things that are under your control and things which are beyond your control. You can’t control every situation and people.”_

“Well, yeah I get it. But I don’t try to control external situations or people. That’s not what I meant. I think one of my major problem is I introspect too much. If I am facing any issue from someone, I will not think about trying to fix them. I will start thinking about fixing my behaviours and reactions to that person or situation..”

_“And what do you think will happen if you didn’t try to control your reactions to that situation?”_

“I don’t know, I haven’t thought about it. But I know I am wasting a lot of my time worrying about things. But I can’t help it. It’s almost like an OCD thing…”

He stops in the middle, seeing her nodding and smiling.

_“Jabbar, will you say that you are afraid to let go?”_

He wasn’t expecting that straight question. 

“Why?...”

He says nervously while trying to make it seem funny.

_“Are you afraid that if you don’t control these situations, you will lose control over yourself?”_

“I told you, I am not trying to control the situations. I just try to control my own reactions to them…. But yeah, I am sometimes worried about letting go.”

_“Yes, but here, you said that you tend to micromanage. It seems to me that you might think you are trying to manage your reaction, but actually you are trying to control these situations so that you don’t lose control over yourself.”_

“Ohkay.”

_“What do you think will happen if you let go?.. Let’s take an example of the incident few days ago. When the guy at work took the credit of your work, you didn’t speak up. Same guy few days back got physical with you. Why didn’t you do anything about that?”_

“I… I don’t know… I guess I hate confrontation. And, I can deal with verbal arguments. But I go out of my way to avoid any physical confrontation or conflict. That’s one of the reasons I tend to feel more comfortable with women in general. Because they seem predictable to me. I know it’s funny to hear that because guys always keep saying that women are hard to understand. But it doesn’t feel that way to me. I can read women, anticipate their behaviours and actions. They won’t.. do anything…u know...”

_“..anything wild..”_

Cardozo finishes his sentence.

“..well..ya..”

_“What do you think will happen if you let go? Do you think another episode will happen?”_

“Well… yeah.. And I really can’t afford to have another episode now. Not at this point of my life.”

_“Look, I think you are confusing standing up for yourself and dealing with bullies with losing it and having another episode. You have to get the fear of having another episode out of your mind. You are taking your medication. You are constantly trying to keep your positive symptoms in check.  You didn’t have an episode in last 2 months. You are trying your best. You need to have some faith in yourself…”_

“You don’t know how it feels! It is easy for you to be able to talk to me like this, in this situation. But imagine not being able to tell the reality from delusion. Imagine having all your beliefs shattered. Imagine your reality being crumbled down right in front of you. Imagine, in an instant, the whole world around you turned into a hostile environment with everyone in it trying to harm you. I can’t go back to that again…”

_“Jabbar, that’s all in your head. You know that…”_

“No!.. during that time, it becomes my reality. You don’t understand. It’s not just in my head. It doesn’t feel that way…I have had these incidents so many time.. But I am still afraid of those situations. Can you imagine how it feels to know that every single creature around you is suddenly your enemy and is trying to get you. You can’t trust anyone. On top of that you are hearing these constant humiliating comments…”

_“..the voices come back?”_

“No.. I mean.. It’s not the way you would think. It’s not how they show it in movies and tv shows. It’s different. It’s like, I can understand what’s going on sometimes, but it’s like your mind is constantly bullying you. It’s like a waking nightmare. In nightmare at least you can wake up and it’s over. But there is no escape from this. I can’t get away from things. I used to try to drown out these things by locking myself up in a room, turning off the lights and putting on the headphones. You would think that should fix it a bit right? .. wrong.. I can’t drown out these chatters.. these noises .. these humiliating voices.. these threats ..”

_“Jabbar, it’s okay. You are trying your best to deal with these. And you have made tremendous progress in these last few years…”_

“Well.. it doesn’t matter. I still feel afraid all the time. Afraid of myself. My mind. It’s like a constant bully within you that you can’t get rid off...”

_“Well… at least you are self-aware. You are aware of your condition. You have done your research about it. You have educated yourself enough to be able to predict and control your symptoms. You have come so far. You have to be less hard on yourself...”_

“Why should I be less hard on myself? .. I mean .. the world won’t be.. right? They won’t make an exception…in fact.. It is the exact opposite. The world keeps throwing one asshole after another at me .. over and over again.”

_“Jabbar, you have to start facing these people. Can’t you see? Your fear of having another episode..or losing it, making you an easy target for these people. Just because you are afraid of losing control over yourself, you are avoiding any form of conflicts with these people. I mean, you are saying that you will let someone take credit for your work to avoid conflicts with him. You are leven letting him get physical with you…”_

“Well.. I know.. It might not be a big deal with other people. He might just be doing these without realising how it makes me feel..”

_“No, I don’t think it’s like that.. these things bothers everyone. Forcing you to do things, physically injuring you… these seem to me like abuse Jabbar. And you might think you will have another episode if you became violent with him. But can’t you see that avoiding it is just as much if not more, leading you to the possibility of another episode ? You might be avoiding physical conflicts, but you are clearly trading that off for mental conflicts. What about those? And we have clearly seen that mental stressors lead you to have episodes...”_

“So you are saying I should also become violent with these people?”

_“Not violent, but maybe you should let your instincts guide you. You are wasting all these energies focusing on trying to control your emotions and your actions. Maybe you should let go sometimes. And see what happens..”_

“I did let go… last time I did, I remember getting a tooth knocked out of me.. and having a major episode... almost a relapse...it’s not that I am not capable.. It’s a choice.. It’s a conscious decision I took not get into another physical conflict with a person. It always ends badly for everyone.”

_“But keeping these inside is making you have mental conflicts also. Isn’t it? And that can also lead you to another relapse.”_

“What should I do then?”

_“Talk to him. Make him realize you are not okay with how things are.”_

“You don’t get it. These guys are bunch of shit heads. They are not the kind you would have a proper conversation with…”

_“Well… you are able to deal with other people in your life right? Including your girlfriend. And as far as I can tell, you have a good skill to persuade people. Then what’s the problem with these abusive people?”_

“That’s different. Like I told you, I can understand women. I can reason with them. I can connect with them. Guys, most of them...are … shallow… they think with their dicks.”

_“What makes you think most guys are shallow?”_

“Well, if they weren’t, then they wouldn’t have been such assholes. They would have had more empathy. Just look at the people around us. These guys seem like they have been let out of some prison. Always jumpy, angry, ready to be provoked. They act without thinking… they don’t have any form of capability to introspect or think.”

_“What makes you think that they also don’t have similar problems.”_

“No, I am not saying that people don’t have problems. Everyone has their own demons to fight. But that doesn’t give you the right to make other people's’ lives hell.”

_“What if I told you that these people you are talking about. These bullies, these shitheads, they are the ones who are most weak, insecure and afraid. Research shows that most bullies are themselves insecure and coward. They themselves are the ones who had been bullied. ”_

“I know that… I have read about these in all the cheesy self-help books. But I don’t agree with that. I mean I have faced multiple traumas in my life. I have faced numerous assholes. I got into more fights than most people of my age. Yet, I don’t pick on innocent people.”

_“Look, there is always a power-play going on among people. And you can’t avoid that...ok, tell me this... have you ever seen a street dog running behind a car or bike, barking?”_

“Yes”

_“What happens when the car stops?”_

“Well, the dog doesn’t bite, that’s for sure….but..ya.. It stops barking.”

_“Exactly!..”_

“Look, I see your point here...but, I don’t wanna deal with these power dynamics. I just wanna be left alone. I don’t want to get into a debate about politics, religion, terrorism. I don’t give a shit about these things. That’s one of the things I hate about these people. They are always debating about terrorism, muslim extremists, politics. I just don’t see the point. I mean you are obviously racist and you think with your dick. So, what’s the point even getting into an argument with you about why all terrorists are muslims. I mean, I can debate with you and present proper, logical arguments. But you won’t listen to any of that would you. You have preconceived notion about me as a Muslim. So, how can I change that. So, why can’t I be left the fuck alone with my own opinion and you can keep yours with you. Don’t drag me into these bullshit conversations.”

_“Jabbar, I told you, if they force you to have these meetings about religion and terrorism again, you should say no.”_

“I did say no. Multiple times. But they force me to attend these. And I don’t wanna be the snob in the room. I mean I tried my best to make people feel comfortable with me. But, unfortunately, it backfires. But, I don’t even want to have to be dragged into these debates.”

_“Having an opinion and keeping it to yourself because you feel that that’s yours and you don’t feel the need to share it, is fine. But keeping your opinion locked inside you because you don’t wanna get into conflict, that’s not okay Jabbar.”_

“I am not keeping my opinions to myself because of fear of conflicts. I am keeping them inside because I don’t know what to believe in anymore. I can’t separate my delusions from reality sometimes. I want to be sure of myself, like all the people around me. But what I can’t comprehend is that how can people say things with such conviction. I mean, how can people be so shallow in their thinking. Why can’t they see that whatever they believe in, can be disproven any minute. And I have realised it even more after my last relapse. When I had to face my delusional thinking… I had to question all of my previously held beliefs. Now, I have developed this obsession Curl Jung and even re-reading Socrates again. And I can’t help but feel like Alice in Wonderland… going down that rabbit hole. So, I make a conscious effort not to spend too much time in my head anymore. And that’s why I tend to avoid voicing my opinions also… because, I feel that, delving into my mind to solve stuff only triggers my delusions. That’s why I came to you. To think things out loud without being labelled insane….”

There’s a knock on the door.

_“Ma’am, your 1 o’clock is waiting.”_

The receptionist peeks through the half closed door.

_“Okay send her in”_

_“Okay”_

Replies the receptionist while closing the door.

_“Well, we are out of time Jabbar. Next time, try to be on time. Okay?...and how much do you know about René Descartes?”_

“Not much. I read about him way back...before the incident. He was a mathematician who invented the cartesian coordinate system right? Almost went insane at one point of his life. I remember bits and pieces of things about him.”

_“Yes. Okay, since you are reading Curl Jung and Socrates, I want you to read up on Descartes this week. And during this week, everytime you feel like questioning what’s real or not and when you start having the delusional thinking, try to write it down briefly and show it to me in the next session. Okay?_

“Alright.”

_“And also, try to reflect on the dog incident that I talked about. Okay?”_

“Ohkay”

Jabbar chuckles.

_“This week, I won’t give you any homework. Just whenever your mind starts racing and you are having trouble processing any incident. Write them down briefly and show them to me next week.”_

“Okay.”

_“See you on Saturday.”_

Says Cardozo while giving him a smile.

“Ya”

Jabbar repplies while closing the door behind him, on his way out of the room. 

**To be continued.**
